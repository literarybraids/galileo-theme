# About the braids

A text is a fabric formed by an interlacing of characters, places and events. Literary Braids arises as a way to visualize the unique framework of each novel. Each string represents a character: when a character comes into action, their line starts vibrating; when they interact with another character, their lines intertwine.

When a book is too long, though, the result can be cumbersome. For this reason, some of the braids will come in a *reduced* form, which forms roughly the same history of the interactions within each chapter, but drastically reducing the length of the braid.

This approach has finally made feasible the braids of *Rayuela*, *Pride and Prejudice* and many more, and has persuaded me to resume this project. 

# The code

This project is mainly written in Python, with some performance-critical functions written in Julia and a bit of Bash here and there. 

# The math (for my nerdy friends)

Several pieces of math have been essential for the development of Literary Braids. Among them, the most important ones are:

* *Arcleng parametrization*, which has made possible that the entangling looks the same all over the braid. 
* *Basic combinatorics*, which has made possible an efficient reduction.
* *Wasserstein distance*, which defines a distance between probability measures, and makes possible to compute how good a particular reduction is. 

# Suggesting one

Please feel free to suggest books for new braids! I haven't read all the books in the world so surely there are interesting pieces that I have not thought about. However, consider that a braid with too many main characters wouldn't make sense (like one of *War and Peace*, *A hundred years of solitude*...), and for a *too* long work the reduction might become meaningless (like maybe for *The Lord of the Rings*). 

# Ordering one

Nothing would give me more pleasure than open a shop for the braids, but I am afraid that at the moment it is impossible for me. However, if enough people support the idea, I may think about something...
