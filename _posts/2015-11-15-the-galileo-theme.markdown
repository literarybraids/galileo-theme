<p class="post-date"> About the braids </p>

Sometimes I think of characters as strings in time, entangling together when they interact. <i>Literary Braids</i> is that idea made real.
 
Given a literary work, my computer program traces the interactions between characters (in order to make it viable it assumes an interaction between two characters is the consecutive mention of their names, nicknames,...). Then I feed it colours and it composes these beautiful staves.




<p class="post-date"> More braids </p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  
    <li><a href="/braids/bernarda_alba.jpg"> <i>La casa de Bernarda Alba</i>, by Federico Garcia Lorca</a></li>
  
    <li><a href="/braids/oldman2.jpg"> <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>, by Ernest Hemingway</a></li>
  
    <li>An example of a book in which you get lost in the braid: <a href="/braids/thentherewherenone_final.jpg"> <i>Then There Where None</i>, by Agatha Christie.</a></li> The interactions are so intrincate you can't see a thing.
  
    <li><a href="/braids/bernarda_alba.jpg"> <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i>, by Milan Kundera.</a></li> We see how the author focus in a couple of characters during considerable lengths of the book.

Please don’t hesitate to contact me at bookbraids@gmail.com if you wish to order a braid of a particular book. For making it I’ll need:
 <ol type="1">
  
    <li>A .txt file of the book.</li>
    <li>A list of the characters you want to consider (max. 10, works better with fewer).</li>
    <li>All the different ways each character is referred to (name, surname, nicknames…).</li>
    <li>The color you want to assign each character (preferably in RGB so that you tell me exactly the colors you want – here you can find the RGB codes for any color you want).</li>
    <li>Peculiar aspects of the novel which may alter how characters are addressed (first person narrator, a switch in the narrator, deliberate typos, etc.)</li>

</ol> 
Prices will depend on the use you want to give it (commercial or personal) and whether you want exclusivity on the braid.
