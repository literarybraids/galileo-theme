# About the code

This project is mainly written in Python, with some performance-critical functions written in Julia and a bit of Bash here and there. 

## The math (for my nerdy friends)

Several pieces of math have been essential for the development of Literary Braids. Among them, the most important ones are:

* *Arcleng parametrization*, which has made possible that the entangling looks the same all over the braid. 
* *Basic combinatorics*, which has made possible an efficient reduction.
* *Wasserstein distance*, which defines a distance between probability measures, and makes possible to compute how good a particular reduction is.
