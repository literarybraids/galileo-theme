<center> Ever wondered what character interactions would <i>look</i> like? </center>

<h1 class="post-date"> About the braids </h1>

Sometimes I think of characters as strings in time, entangling together as they interact with each other. <i>Literary Braids</i> is that idea made real.
 
Given a literary work, my computer program traces the interactions between characters. Then I feed it colours to compose these beautiful patterns.

Once I developed this, I continued thinking of other kinds of visualizing the information enclosed in a book. Here you have some more examples.

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="/braids/alice_grid.png" alt="" alt = "" height /><a href="/braids/alices_grid.png">
    <p class="post-image-caption"> Just a summary of the interactions in <i>Alice</i>    </p></a>
</div>

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="/braids/alice_splines_deg3.png" alt="" alt = "" height /><a href="/braids/alices_splines_deg3.png">
    <p class="post-image-caption">Another graph: evolution of the frequencies of mention for each character in <i> Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.</i> We can quickly see when each character appears and its importance in every moment.  </p></a>
