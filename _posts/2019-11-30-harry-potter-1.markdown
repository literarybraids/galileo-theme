*Harry Potter* is one of those sagas with which our generation has grown up, and many of us remember even the smallest dialogues with an astounding precission. It has taken so long to bring it to Literary Braids because, for such a short book, the braid was incredibly long! The characters are explicitly referred to very frequently, and that makes the interactions add up and up. This made it necessary to represent a *reduced* version of the braid (more on this in an upcoming post!). For comparison, below I leave the *unreduced* braid of the same book:

As you may realize, the amount of interactions has been greatly reduced, but the basic structure of the story stays more or less the same.   

If we start following the braid from the beginning, we will first attend to Harry's arrival to Private Drive and his traumatized childhood with the Dursleys. After half a turn Hagrid comes and start telling him about the wizards' world. This main interaction lasts about half a turn, after which Harry meets Ron and Hermione in the Hogwarts Express, which starts a bond that will last throughout the whole braid.

        In the grid we see that the strongest bonds of the Little Prince correspond to the most iconic characters in our memory: the Rose, the Fox and the King. It is a bit sad to see the poor Lamplighter so underrepresented, but it is true that he appears only for a short part of the book        </p>
