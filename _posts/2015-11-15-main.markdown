<center> Ever wondered what character interactions would <i>look</i> like? </center>

<center> Come down the rabbit hole: </center>

<h1 class="post-date"> About the braids </h1>

Sometimes I think of characters as strings in time, entangling together when they interact. <i>Literary Braids</i> is that idea made real.
 
Given a literary work, my computer program traces the interactions between characters. Then I feed it colours to compose these beautiful staves.




<h1 class="post-date"> More braids </h1>

 <ol type="1">
  
   
    <li><a href="/braids/oldman2.jpg"> <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>, by Ernest Hemingway</a></li>
        
    <li><a href="/braids/unbearable.jpg"> <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i>, by Milan Kundera.</a></li> We see how the author focus in a couple of characters during considerable lengths of the book.
  
    <li>A colourful one: <a href="/braids/thursday.jpg"> <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i>, by G. K. Chesterton.</a></li> I'm quite fond of this one: love the way Thursday guides the novel and the omnipresence of Sunday.
  
    <li>An example of a book in which you get lost in the braid: <a href="/braids/thentherewherenone_final.jpg"> <i>Then There Where None</i>, by Agatha Christie.</a></li> The interactions are so intrincate you can't see a thing.
  
    
    <li><a href="/braids/bernarda_alba.jpg"> <i>La casa de Bernarda Alba</i>, by Federico Garcia Lorca</a></li>

<h1 class="post-date"> How to get one </h1>
    
Please don’t hesitate to contact me at <a href="mailto:ismaelmedinasuarez@gmail.com">ismaelmedinasuarez@gmail.com</a> if you wish to order a braid of a particular book. For making it I’ll need:
 <ol type="1">
  
    <li>A .txt file of the book.</li>
    <li>A list of the characters you want to consider (max. 10, works better with fewer).</li>
    <li>All the different ways each character is referred to (name, surname, nicknames…).</li>
    <li>The color you want to assign each character (preferably in RGB so that you tell me exactly the colors you want – here you can find the RGB codes for any color you want).</li>
    <li>Peculiar aspects of the novel which may alter how characters are addressed (first person narrator, a switch in the narrator, deliberate typos, etc.)</li>

</ol>
