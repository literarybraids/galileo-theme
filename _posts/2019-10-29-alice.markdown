From the moment I started making these braids, *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* has been my reference book. The characters and their order are easily recognizable, the action is organized by Alice and the length of the book is just perfect for seeing everything with clarity. The chase of the White Rabbit is perfectly recognizable, as well as the encounter with the Cheshire Cat and the feast with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare.

        <p style="margin-top:15mm;">The organizing role of Alice can be also well appreciated in the *grid*, which is a summary of the interactions in the book: all characters interact more with Alice than with any other character. </p>
        <p> 
        For these reasons, <i>Alice</i> holds the honor of opening this new edition of Literary Braids, which I hope lasts long and brings the best books to get entangled.
